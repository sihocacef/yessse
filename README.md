BTS World Hack without verification has been basically developer by iOS developer. Why does Android want to "whip the corpse"? The answer is very simple. The working BTS World Cheat has a strong rival in US, Sony itself. You know, although the sales of the PS4 in Japan are crushing Xbox One badly, there is still a big gap with real Gems generator units of the previous generation of PS3 in the same period, and the first two years of the PS3's launch may be narrower than today's Xbox One. Although the shrinkage of Japan's mainframe market is a big trend (market share has shrunk by half in the past seven years), it is clear that Sony's expectations for its home market go beyond that.

If we think of BTS World cheating glitch as a more socially responsible tool, the price reduction in Japan may also imply a better platform for Japanese manufacturers. The once thriving Japanese game market has been declining since the PS3 era. More local PS4 holdings may also provide a bright way for the mainstream platform game developers whose works are mainly Japanese players. If Sony really wants to do so, the price reduction can be interpreted as a "just act", but since Sony has not yet shouted the slogan loudly, it is likely that this is just another beautiful misunderstanding without intent.
